-- friendly-snippets: It contains several snippets in different
-- languages, which are put into the json document. This plugin requires a
-- snippet engine to load it, and we use LuaSnip as the loading engine.

-- LuaSnip: Snippet engine for Neovim which supports various filetype. This
-- plugin finally used by nvim-cmp.
-- NOTE: LuaSnip cannot be used directly by nvim-cmp, which relies on the
-- saadparwaiz1/cmp_luasnip plugin. The installation code for the cmp_luasnip
-- plugin is placed together with the installation code for nvim-cmp.
