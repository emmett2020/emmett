# Memory Management in C++: Tools to Prevent Leaks
Memory management in C++ is a critical yet challenging aspect of development, especially when manually allocating and deallocating memory. Relying solely on developers to avoid memory leaks is not a reliable approach. To address this, tools like [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/info/tools.html#memcheck) and [AddressSanitizer (ASan)](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer) are invaluable for detecting and preventing memory-related issues.

Depp dive into valgrind:

Below is a detailed comparison of the key differences between and ASan:

| **Feature**         | **Valgrind**                             | **AddressSanitizer (ASan)**             |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Type**            | Dynamic analysis tool                | Compiler-integrated tool            |
| **Performance**     | Slower (runs in a virtual machine)   | Faster (compiled into the program)  |
| **Ease of Use**     | Requires no code changes             | Requires recompilation with flags   |
| **Detection Scope** | Broad (memory leaks, invalid access) | Focused (memory errors, leaks)      |
| **Platform Support**| Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, etc.)  | Primarily Linux, macOS, and Windows |


By leveraging these tools, developers can significantly reduce the risk of memory leaks and improve the overall stability of their applications.

# Run this demo with valgrind:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -GNinja
cmake --build build
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ./build/memory_leak
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ./build/safely_allocate_memory
```

If everything fine, you'll get this output generated by valgrind:

# Run this demo with ASan:
```bash
# Just add some compilation arguments to your CMakeLists.txt
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g -O1 ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS}")

# -fsanitize=address: Enables AddressSanitizer.
# -fno-omit-frame-pointer: Ensures stack traces are readable.
# -g: Includes debugging symbols for better error reporting.
# -O1: get better running performance

cmake -S . -B build -GNinja
cmake --build build
