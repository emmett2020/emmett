# C++ Project
## 1. Add a new C++ subproject
1. Create subproject in suitable directory, e.g. bench/your_sub_directory
2. Copy CMakeLists.txt to the new subproject. Then modify CMakeLists.txt to add your basic compilation workflow.
3. Add this new subproject's path into .clangd to enable LSP for C++.
4. (Optional) Add a README.md to describe what this new subproject will do.

## 2. Perform formatting and code syntax checks before submit.
You need to install some tools to enable automatically source code static analysis and get all things passed before you submit a pull request.
|     Tool      |   Version   |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| clang-tidy    |   20.0.0+   |
| clang-format  |   20.0.0+   |

Instead of installing these tools directly, you can opt for the Language Server Protocol (LSP), which integrates these tools seamlessly. One of the most widely used LSP implementations is clangd, a part of the LLVM project. clangd offers features like code completion, go-to-definition, format checking, and code linting.

Using clangd is quite straightforward these days. If you're using VSCode, simply install the clangd VSCode Extension and configure it. For Neovim users, you can utilize Mason to download and set it up. While I haven't tested it on other IDEs, the process is likely similarly simple.

Ensure that your clangd version is 20.0.0 or higher for optimal functionality.

# Shell Scripts
## 1. Add a new shell script
Your scripts should include the following elements:
1. Proper "here document": Provide clear documentation at the beginning of the script, specifying whether root permissions are required or if there are any other limitations.
2. set -euo pipefail: Ensure robust error handling by including this line at the start of your script.
3. Your function: Define the core functionality of the script.

Each script should have a minimized and focused purpose. Avoid referencing other scripts unless absolutely necessary.
Once your script has been thoroughly tested and passes all checks, place it in the appropriate directory:
For x86-64 only scripts, place them in ubuntu/x86.
For scripts that support both x86 and ARM, place them directly in the ubuntu directory.
We prefer writing architecture-specific or OS-specific scripts even if it results in some code redundancy, as this approach ensures clarity and maintainability.

## 2. Perform formatting and code syntax checks before submit
|     Tool      |   Version   |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| shfmt         |   0.10.0+   |
| shellcheck    |   3.10.0+   |
